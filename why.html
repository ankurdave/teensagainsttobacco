<h4>Tobacco is deadly</h4>

<p>Tobacco kills up to half of its users: around 5 million people die each year because of tobacco use—that’s one person every six seconds. If trends continue, tobacco could kill 1 billion people in the 21st century. Worldwide, smoking is the second highest preventable risk factor for death, after hypertension.</p>

<h4>Tobacco affects non-users</h4>

<p>In some countries, children from poor households work with tobacco and often develop “green tobacco sickness” from the nicotine in wet tobacco leaves. 600,000 people die each year because of secondhand smoke. Of these, more than 65% are women and children.</p>

<h4>Tobacco costs us and nature</h4>

<p>Tobacco causes myriad illnesses and diseases, forcing families to pay thousands of dollars in medical bills. Tobacco use causes an increase in insurance premiums to cover the sicknesses caused by tobacco use. Burning cigarettes have caused many wildfires, costing billions of dollars in property damage and causing massive environmental destruction. Cigarettes, cigarette boxes, and plastic chewing tobacco pouches litter cities and parks across the globe.</p>
