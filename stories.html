<p>Mubin Noray was a man in his late thirties. He, his wife, and his two young daughters lived in Shoreline, Washington.</p>

<p>In 20XX, Mubin was diagnosed with throat cancer. Doctors gave him just four months to live. In the following weeks his tongue and throat were removed to prevent the cancer from spreading. He could only eat through an opening above his chest. He lost his voice and could communicate only through writing.</p>

<p>Before his diagnosis, Mubin was a civil engineer by profession and was working towards his MBA at the University of Washington. At the time of this interview, he hadn't spoken or eaten anything through his mouth for months.</p>

<p>Mubin has a strong message: Don't use tobacco. His last wish was to reach out to the community and save others from this agonizing and deadly habit that caused him and his family such great pain.</p>
